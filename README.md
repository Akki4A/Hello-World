# Hello-World
My first repository
I love to code in python and my passion is to become a good software engineer.
One day when i look back at this repository of mine, i will surely tell my self that,
"Yaa I made it", it was not that easy as it seems but eventually i am there where i want to be.
future akki will write from here onwards...
